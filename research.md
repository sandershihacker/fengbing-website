Movement and division are two prominent and contrasting themes in discourses
about contemporary society. Contemporary society is often characterized as being
marked by unprecedented levels of movement of people, goods and information. A
different theme, however, is that of barriers and division (e.g. residential
segregation, social exclusion or immigration controls). Our focus on migration
and divided groups brings these two themes together in a single framework with
the hope of providing insights into each of the two phenomena. This research
cluster specifically examines issues of migrant groups settling down in a new
cosmopolitan city, focusing particularly on how different migrant groups (i.e.
migrant farmers and migrant college graduates, or returned scholars and
businessmen from overseas) are adapting to their new lives in their host city.
Such adapting process involves job-hunting, career promotion and everyday life
experiences in the new city, including cultural convergence of tastes,
lifestyles and consumer preferences. The cluster also examines how the new
migrants are constructing their new roles and identities. The research cluster
attempts to relate migrant groupsâ€™ life and work experiences with their cultural
and social capital which might characterize migrant groups from different social
backgrounds. It further explores the theoretical conceptualizations of class and
social stratification.
