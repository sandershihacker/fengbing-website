To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:
{% highlight python %}
def fun(n):
    if (n == 0):
        return 1
    elif (n > 0):
        return n * fun(n - 1)
    else:
        return 0
{% endhighlight %}
