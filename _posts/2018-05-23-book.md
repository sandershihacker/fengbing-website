## About the Book

This book is concerned with the ethnie experience of Chinese secondary school
children living in Northern Ireland. The author analyses two sub-groups of
Chinese children: those with parents coming from Hong Kong and those with
parents coming from Mainland China. The purpose of this study is to investigate
how these apparently 'Chinese' children feel about their ethnic identity. By
drawing upon Bourdieu's concepts of habitus, and a cultural studies' approach
to ethnicity and identity in general, the author examines the characteristics of
cultural specificity and heterogeneity. Methodologically, the author has chosen
an ethnographic approach. Prominence is given to the definitions, perspectives
and voices of the children themselves by conducting open-ended, indepth and
informal interviews and by doing so on an extended basis. The whole process
continued for two and half years. Close attention was paid to the children's
immediate circumstances, their parental occupations and their general social and
cultural conditions.
